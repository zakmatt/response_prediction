The repository consists of two files:  
`data_analysis.ipynb` which analyses the dataset, extracts valuable features and creates training and test sets.  
`design_classifier.ipynb` which implements a logistic regression classifier using pytorch, trains it on the training data 
and generates scores over the test set.
